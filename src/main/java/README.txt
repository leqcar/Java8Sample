What is Lambda?

A lambda expression can be understood as a concise representation of an anonymous function
that can be passed around: it doesnâ€™t have a name, but it has a list of parameters, a body, a
return type, and also possibly a list of exceptions that can be thrown.

Anonymous - Because it doesnt have an explict name like a method would normally have.

Function - It isnt associated with a particular class like a method is.

Passed Around - can be passed as argument to a method or stored in a variable

Concise - small but informative, no need to write lots of boilerplate codes like in an anonymous classes.
